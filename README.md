## Project Overview -
- The Calculate a weight of an object on a planetweb page allows users to calculate the weight of an object on different planets in our solar system. To use the app, the user selects a planet and inputs the weight of the object. The app then calculates and displays the weight of the object on the selected planet.

## Goals & Objectives -
- Develop a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate and use.
- Allow users to select a planet and input the weight of an object.
- Use JavaScript to calculate the weight of the object on the selected planet.
- Display the calculated weight to the user in a clear and easy-to-understand way.
- Ensure that the app is accurate and reliable in its calculations.

## Technologies -
- HTML5: This is a markup language used to structure content on the web page, including headings, paragraphs, links, and images.
- CSS3: This is a style sheet language used to define the visual appearance of the web page, including fonts, colors, layouts, and animations.
- Javascript: JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It allows you to add     logic and functionality to your web app, such as the weight calculator functionality.
- Git : Git is a version control system that allows you to manage and track changes to your codebase. It helps you to collaborate with others and keep track of your     project history.
- GitHub : GitHub is a web-based platform that allows you to host and manage your Git repositories. It provides a range of features, such as collaboration tools, issue   tracking, and pull requests, to help you work on your project with others.
